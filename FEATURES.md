### BPTimer Integration

**Location**: Settings Window → BPTimer Integration section

**Setting**: Submit boss HP data to BPTimer

**What it does**: Automatically submits boss health threshold data to the BPTimer community database when you fight field bosses.

**Why use it**: Helps the community track field boss spawn times by collecting data on when bosses are defeated.

**Privacy note**: Only boss HP thresholds are submitted - no personal information or player names are sent.

**Default**: Enabled

**Recommendation**: Keep enabled if you frequently fight field bosses to contribute to the community.

---

### Auto Clear Options

**Location**: Settings Window → Auto Clear Options section

#### Clear data on server change
**What it does**: Automatically resets all DPS statistics when you change servers or zones.

**When to use**:
- Enable if you want fresh statistics for each zone/dungeon
- Enable if you do multiple different activities (prevents mixing data)

**When to disable**:
- If you want continuous statistics across zone changes
- If you manually prefer to reset statistics

**Default**: Enabled

**Recommendation**: Keep enabled for most users to maintain clean, per-zone statistics.

---

#### Clear data on inactivity timeout
**What it does**: Automatically resets statistics after a specified period with no combat activity.

**When to use**:
- Enable if you take breaks between fights and want automatic cleanup
- Enable if you want separate statistics for each engagement

**When to disable**:
- If you want statistics to persist across breaks
- If you're doing sporadic combat with long idle periods

**Default**: Disabled

**Configuration**: Set timeout duration (1-300 seconds)
- Default: 20 seconds
- Lower values = more aggressive cleanup
- Higher values = longer retention after combat ends

**Recommendation**: Enable with 30-60 second timeout for dungeon content where you have breaks between pulls.

---

### Performance Options

**Location**: Settings Window → Performance Options section

#### Performance mode (reduce CPU/GPU usage)
**What it does**: Reduces the update frequency from 100ms to 250ms to lower CPU and GPU usage.

**Impact**:
- Reduces FPS drops and system load
- Lower power consumption (good for laptops)
- Slightly less responsive UI updates (still very usable)

**When to enable**:
- If you experience frame drops in-game
- If your system has limited resources
- If you're on a laptop and want better battery life

**Default**: Disabled

**Recommendation**: Enable if you notice any performance impact from the DPS meter.

---

#### Update interval (ms)
**What it does**: Controls how frequently the DPS meter updates its display (in milliseconds).

**Range**: 50ms - 1000ms
- Lower values = more responsive but higher CPU usage
- Higher values = less responsive but better performance

**Default**: 100ms

**Note**: This setting is only available when Performance Mode is disabled. Performance Mode automatically sets this to 250ms.

**Recommendation**: 
- 50-100ms: For high-end systems that want maximum responsiveness
- 150-250ms: Balanced option for most users
- 300-500ms: Low-end systems or maximum battery saving

---

#### Transparency Amount
**What it does**: Adjusts the transparency level of all application windows from 0% (fully transparent) to 100% (fully opaque).

**Default**: 70%

**Note**: For absolute best performance, disable transparency entirely using the "Disable window transparency" option below instead of using the slider.

---

#### Disable window transparency
**What it does**: Removes the transparent window background completely, using a solid black background instead.

**Impact**:
- Significantly reduces GPU load
- Best performance improvement option
- Requires application restart to take full effect
- Less visually integrated with game UI
- Overrides the transparency slider when enabled

**When to enable**:
- If you have performance issues
- If you have an older GPU
- If you prioritize performance over aesthetics

**Default**: Disabled

**Recommendation**: Enable this if you want the absolute best performance. This is the single most effective performance setting. If you just want to adjust transparency, use the slider above instead.

---
